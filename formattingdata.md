# Data Formats

The Vistorian imports data formatted in tables in csv format (comma separated values, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values) files. Each csv contains one table. You can export csv-files from:

* MS Excel (File > Save As > Select file type ‘CSV’)
* Apple’s Numbers (File -> Export to -> CSV),
* google spreadsheets (File -> Download as -> Comma-separated values), or
* you can create CSV by hand in any text editor.

If you have edited or compiled your data files manually, you can use the free online tool CSVLint to check if your CSV file is properly formatted.

This page explains what information you can put in your CSV files so The Vistorian can visualize it. There are some rules to follow where which information goes.
