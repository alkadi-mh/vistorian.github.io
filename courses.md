The Vistorian team is running a **free hands-on online course** that teaches the basics of exploring temporal, geographical, and multivariate network data (e.g., social networks) through interactive network visualizations.
Exploratory network analysis is suitable for participants working or planning to work with qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods research, at any stage of their research process.

We will be using [The Vistorian](https://vistorian.github.io), an online tool that provides four visualizations for networks: node-link diagrams, adjacency matrices, a timeline, and a map. Each visualization provides a complementary view of your network data. This course will assist you in visual network exploration as well as in prepareing your network data.

The course includes **one 2-hour long session per week for 5 weeks (Jan 12-Feb 9, 2022)** and potentially more time at home to prepare and work with your own data.



* **Structure your network data** and prepare it for visualization with the Vistorian.
* **Define goals of your exploration** and what you aim to learn about your network data using visualizations.
* **Know a range of network visualization techniques**, throug theory and exploration. 
* **Use different types of interactive visualizations** and conduct basic exploratory analysis.

The course combines **brief lectures** with **hands-on activities** and space for **discussions** and **individual support**. The course will include case-studies and discussions about exploratory network research.

## Info Sessions

We run 2 **open info sessions** on  _Thursday 9th AND _Thursday 16th December from 5:00-6:00 PM UK time_. The session will walk you throught the course, demo the Vistorian, and give you the opportunity to meet us and discuss questions before signing up.

## Prerequisites and requirements
* **No technical or programming** skills are required. The course is primarily tailored towards scholars in the humanities.
* **No pre-knowledge in network analysis** of terminology is required. We start with the very basics and introduce all terminology necessary for the course. 
* We expect participants to be **working with their own network** data during the duration of the course as the course will help you working with that data set. If you do not have your own dataset, we can provide you with demo data.
* Your **data should not be too large** as any visualization of large data sets is challenging in itself. An ideal size for the course is up to 500 links in your network. Ideally, your networks has fewer links to make best use of the activities and visualizations.
* **Your dataset can contain any of the following aspects:**
    * Geographic information (such as place names). No coordinates are required. 
    * Temporal information such as the precise time a relationship is active (e.g., a day) or their start and end date. 
    * Multiple links between the same two nodes (such as individual letters sent between two people
    * Directed links (such as a letter send from person A to person B) or undirected links
    * Weighted links (such as strength of a social relationship)
    * Different types links (such as different types of social relationships) 
    * Different types of nodes.
* **Software requirements:** 
    * No specific software needs to be installed
    * Any software that allows you to edit tables such as Excel or spreadsheets in Google Drive. 
    * For visualization, we will use a web application that runs in your browser. 


## Key Information:
* The course is **free of charge and open to everybody** to register. You do not have to be based in the UK. 
* We have a **limited number of 20 places**. Priority will be given to those who bring their own dataset to explore; even if it isnâ€™t fully prepared and formatted.
* For **5 weeks, we meet every Wednesday from 3pm to 5pm (UK time)**.
* Each of these sessions consists of some theoretical explanations (lasting roughly 30 minutes), some hands-on activities, and time for discussion.  
* The course runs online, **using Zoom**
* We encourage everyone to **bring their own data** they want to create networks from.
* We **will explain how to format your data** if you want to use your own data in the subsequent sessions.
* If you do not have own data at the moment, we can provide you with demo data. However, you will get the most out of this course if you bring own data. 
* Between sessions, **there might be smaller homework tasks** to last the pace with the course (e.g., complete data cleaning, complete data formatting, upload your data into the Vistorian, etc.). We suggest reserving the necessary time for this before committing to the course As the course has a limited number of places and we want every participant to take full advantage of the course. The time you want to allocate will depend on what it takes you to properly format your data within a table such as Excel.



## Registeration
* Registration link will take you to a form which will take between 5-15min: [click here to register](https://forms.office.com/r/qAnvASgRyJ)
* Applicants who have their own data to visualize will be prioritized.
* The course might be offered again in future, depending on demand and funding support. 
* By registering to the course you:
    * consent to the ethics form provided both here and in the registeration form.
    * plan to attend to all 5 sessions.
    * ensure that you have read all of the key information mentioned above.

## What to prepare before the course? 
* You should have a dataset that you want to visualize. Ideally, this data set is already formatted in some machine readable format such as a table in Excel or a CSV file. 
* We would ask each participant to prepare a 3min pitch to introduce themself to the other participants and the course organisers. Please prepare around 3 slides with the following information
  * Your general background and research
  * The data set you are working with (we acknowledge that you may not want to disclose too much information about this. In that case, keep this part short and high level)
  * Any challenges you have faced working with the data set (e.g., previous tools you have used) and your specific research questions.

# FAQs

### How does the Vistorian handle my data? 
While The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. Consequently, you do not need any login but also you cannot share your visualizations with colleagues. 

### Are you gathering any usage data?
Please refer to the ethics forms approved by the ethics committee at University of Edinburgh for a detailed description on how we handle your data. <a href="https://uoe-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/s2002120_ed_ac_uk/EQkbeqU1UsZKtMq1BrugeFIBwBllQyMOWdFHqjD9Xz1Thg?e=aPkLi6">Participant Consent Form</a>
