**The University of Edinburgh is running a _free 5-weeks_ online course that teaches the basics of exploring temporal, geographical, and multivariate network data (e.g., social networks) through interactive visualizations in [The Vistorian](https://vistorian.github.io). This course will not assist you only in your visual network exploration but also in your network data prepration.**

**The Vistorian provides a set of four dedicated visualizations for network visualizations: the node-link diagram, adjacency matrix, timeline, and map. Each visualization provides a complementary view of your network data.**

_Exploratory network analysis_ is suitable for _participants working or planning to work with qualitative, quantitative, or mixed-methods research, at any stage of their research process._ This course provides a hands-on overview of exploratory network analysis techniques including interactive data visualizations with The Vistorian.

The course is focused on researchers - beginners - who have a network dataset they want to explore and visualize. You can still participate if you cannot bring your own data. We can provide you with demo data to use during the sessions, and you can apply what you have learned to your data later. 

By the end of the course, you will be able to:
* Structure your network data and prepare it for visualization with the Vistorian.
* Define goals of your exploration and what you aim to learn about your network data using visualizations.
* Conduct basic exploratory analysis using different types of interactive visualizations.
* Learn the difference between different visualization types and their use in an exploration process.


The course combines brief lectures with workshop-style activities and space for discussions and individual support The course will include case-studies and discussions about exploratory network research.

## Key Information

* The course is free of charge and open to everybody to register. 
* We have a limited number of seats of  20-30 participants and priority for those who have their own dataset to explore; even if it isn’t fully prepared and formatted.
* Once you have been accepted, you will be sent an email containing the information needed to join.
* _For 5 weeks, we meet every Wednesday from 3:00 to 5:00 PM UK time_.
* A session consists of some explanations (lasting roughly 30 minutes), some hands-on activities, and time for discussion.  
The course is run online, using MS Teams (download here).
* For the first session, you don’t have to prepare anything. The only thing you need is your data in any format you have. We will explain how to format your data if you want to use your own data in the subsequent sessions.
* Between sessions, there might be smaller homework tasks to do to stay on pace with the course (e.g., complete data cleaning, complete data formatting, upload your data into the Vistorian, etc.). We suggest reserving the necessary time for this before committing to the course since the course has a limited number of places and we want every participant to take full advantage of the course.  The time allocated depends on the size of your data; varying from 1-4 hours.

## Info session
Those session are offered to give an overview about the course and answer your questions. It will take place on  _Thursday 9th AND _Thursday 16th December from 5:00-6:00 PM UK time_

This info session will run as following:  
* 5:00-5:05 Welcome and Introduction

# FAQs

### How does the Vistorian handle my data? 
While The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. Consequently, you do not need any login but also you cannot share your visualizations with colleagues. 

### Are you gathering any usage data?
Please refer to the ethics forms approved by the ethics committee at University of Edinburgh for a detailed description on how we handle your data.
