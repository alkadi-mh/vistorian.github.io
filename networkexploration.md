# Network Exploration Strategies

This page lists commmon methods and strategies to help you exploring networks with (interactive) visualizations. 

Content on this page is split into 
1. Data Shaping -> those are any methods to create a (set of) link or node table(s)
2. Data Cleaning -> check for consistency in your data table
3. Reducing the size of my network 
4. Projection
5. Visual Exploration -> a set of questions you can ask yourself when exploring a network through a visualization 

## Data Cleaning Strategies

- *coming soon* 

## Strategies for reducing the size of your network

- by node type
- by link type
- by time
- select nodes with highest degree / most links

## Projection

- 

## Visual Patterns

These are visual patterns that you could look out in your network visualization. These visual patterns describe information in your network.

- Highly connected nodes
- Clusters
- Bridges (connect clusters)
- Neighbors
- Paths
- Motifs
- Multiple links
- Node and link colors and widths (i.e., node and link attributes)
- ...

## Exploration Questions

- What are other central nodes?
- What are the isolated nodes?
- Are the central nodes connected or not?
- Does the network has clusters? 
- How are these clusters? 
- Are clusters connected? 
- What is the distribution of specific link types?
- How does the network evolve over time? 
- When do specific link types occur in time?
- How do communities form?
- Links incoming, outgoing from a specific node
- ...
