# The Vistorian 

[The Vistorian](http://vistorian.net) is an online tool for **interactive exploration** of dynamic, multivariate, and geographic networks.

**Interactive exploration means to discover and scrutinize your data through interactive queries and multiple complementary perspectives (visualizations).** The idea of exploratory data analysis (EDA) goes back to the [American statistician John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey).

The Vistorian is an active research project at the [Vishub at the University of Edinburgh](http://visualinteractivedata.github.io) and [Inria, France](http://aviz.fr/). If you're using the Vistorian for your work, please cite our [poster](#cite-the-vistorian)Â and send us feedback and examples of your work of our gallery. This helps us keeping the Vistorian funded. Similarly, if you find bugs, send us screenshots and descriptions, we're happy to help you with your data.

## Why the Vistorian?

The Vistorian provides four [interactive visualizations](visualizations.html) to help explore networks:

* [Node-link diagram](visualizations.html#node-link): shows networks in the traditional force-directed layout. This visualization is a great start to gain an overview and see the network changing over time. 
* [Adjacency matrix](visualizations.html#adjacency-matrix): shows your network in a compact table format to help visulize very dense networks. It allows you understand clusters using differnet [matrix serialization methods](https://hal.inria.fr/hal-01326759/document).
* [Timeline](visualizations.html#time-arcs): shows you network over time to track frequency and pace of connectivity in your network.
* [Map](visualizations.html#map): shows your network on an interactive map.
