# The Vistorian 

[The Vistorian](http://vistorian.net) is an online tool for interactive exploration of dynamic multivariate and geographic networks. **Interactive exploration means to discover and scrutinize your data through interactive queries and multiple complementary perspectives (visualizations).** The idea of exploratory data analysis (EDA) goes back to the [American statisticiian John Tukey](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Tukey).

The Vistorian is a research project. If you're using the Vistorian for your work, please cite our posterÂ and send us feedback and examples of your work of our gallery. This helps us keeping the Vistorian funded. Similarly, if you find bugs, send us screenshots and descriptions, we're happy to help you with your data.



## Why the Vistorian?

![image](figures/vistorian-visualizations.png)

The Vistorian provides four [interactive visualizations](visualizations.html) to help you explore your networks: 
* [Node-link diagram](visualizations.html#node-link): shows networks in the traditional force-directed layout.
* [Adjacency matrix](visualizations.html#adjacency-matrix): shows your network in a compact table format to help visulize very dense networks.
* [Timeline](visualizations.html#time-arcs): shows you network over time
* [Map](visualizations.html#map): shows your network on an interactive map.
