# Vistorian Lab

## What is Vistorian Lab?

VistorianLab is a tool that will assist you in your work, research, exploration, and any other scientific goals. It will assist you to create your own bookmarks while creating Vistorian visualizations.  Each bookmark will hold the state of the currently-selected dataset and chosen network upon the time of creation. It enables you also to add your own notes and classify them based on their purpose. In addition, you can easily share them with your colleagues to review and discuss your work.
