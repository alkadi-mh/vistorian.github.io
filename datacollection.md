# Anonymous Data Collection While Enabling VistorianLabs

To learn more about our research with The Vistorian, visit our [research page](vistorianlabs.html)

The consent and information sheets you have to agee to before enabling VistorianLabs can be found [here](studyPhase1_activityLogging.html) and [here](studyPhase2_LongitudinalCaseStudy.html).

## What we are logging

Only if VistorianLabs is enabled, we will anonymously log how you use specific features in the Vistorian, such as:

* Which visualizations you use
* Which visualization features you use (e.g., search, filter, pan, zoom, etc.)
* How long you you stay on each visualization
* How often you visit The Vistorian.
* For a comprehensive list of each logged event see our wiki. 
* Each logged event will store: 
* Time and date of the event,
* Type of event (hover a node, move the time slider, visit matrix visualization, etc.), 

An anonymous ID (found in the in the URL: e.g., session=1591290293452). This ID is a random generated number, independent from your IP or other specific user data. You can delete and reset that ID by refreshing your browser cache. The ID is stored in your browser, not in any cookie. 

The anonymous logged events will be saved on a secure server which is accessible only by the Vistorian team. They help us to understand which features in Vistorian are most used, which ones are not used, and help us to improve these features as well as our instructions and tutorials. 

## What we are NOT logging

We do not log any data beyond the above stated. For example: 

* We do not log the data you visualize in the Vistorian 
* We do not log the position of your mouse on screen
* We do not screencast your screen or take screenshots.
* We do not access your camera, keyboard or any other device.
* We do not log any other open tabs or windows in your browser or computer
* We do not store or install any software, cookies, or other files or programs on your computer. The Vistorian runs entirely in your browser.
