# Tours


A tour in Network Narratives is best imagined as a slide-deck. Each slide tells you something about your network. A tour consists of
* slides, showing a single fact about your network (e.g., the most connected node), and 
* sections, grouping slides of a specific topic (e.g., centrality measures).

Slides in a tour are calculated by Network Narratives once a tour has been selected. 

You can use the [Navigation Bar](networknarratives/userinterface.html#navigation-bar) to navigate between slides. 

* Some slides propose **detours**, i.e., by including similar slides on demand, e.g., to learn more about a specific topic fact shown on a slide. 
* Other slides link to **related tours**, e.g., to learn more about the [ego network](networknarratives/tours.html#ego-network-exploration) of a node mentioned at that slide.
