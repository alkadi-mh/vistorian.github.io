The University of Edinburgh is running an open workshop to help visualize your networks with [The Vistorian](https://vistorian.github.io). The Vistorian is an application that provides a set of interactive network visualizations (node-link diagram, matrix, timeline, and map) to visualize geographical, temporal, and multivariate networks. No coding or download is required. The Vistorian runs in your web browser with your data stored securely on your machine.

The tutorial is aimed for everyone wanting to visualize and visually explore complex network data. The Vistorian can help with geographic, temporal and multivariate networks. There is a size limit of around 1000 links for the time being.  

The Vistorian is tool created in close relationship with our [research in data visualization](http://visualinteractivedata.github.io) and aims to both provide novel and powerful visualizations for complex networks and help making these visualizations more accessible. We are keen to learn from your experience and improve our tool.

Our tutorial is build around the following parts and will run on June 3rd, with optional Q&A and drop-in sessions over the summer.

## Overview session (1h):
has taken place on:  _Thursday, June 3rd  2021, 4-5pm UK time_

This intro covered:  
* overviewing visualization techniques for dynamic, geographic, and multivariate networks,

# FAQs

### Who is eligible?
While the tutorial is open to anyone with an interest in data visualization (especially dynamic networks), most benefits will be to those with question(s) in mind who would like to address through interactivity, bookmarks, states restoration , notes and states exchange.

### How does the Vistorian handle my data? 
While The Vistorian is a web application, i.e., it runs in your browser, your data will remain on your machine and will not be transmitted to any other machine. Consequently, you do not need any login but also you cannot share your visualizations with colleagues. 

### Are you gathering any usage data?
By default, we do not track your usage of the system. As part of our ongoing research, we we provide an opt-in option for us to anonymously track your usage and anoymously analyze these usage data. This does not include your network data. More information can be found on our [research page](vistorianLab.html).

<!-- We seek anyone interested in creating interactive dynamic networks and logging their progress through states and notetaking (https://vistorian.github.io/ ) to join our tutorial: learn how to create interactive dynamic networks with The Vistorian and give us feedback to improve it. The live tutorial will be held on June 3rd , 4pm UK time (a video recording will be made available) to get you started, and then you will be able to create your own visualization with your own dataset(s), at your own pace. We will be available for questions and help and to gather feedback and answer your questions on a weekly basis (10th June, 17th June) 4-6 PM with a pre-booked timeslots.

No preparation is required prior to the tutorial session. Demo dataset(s) will be provided at the start of the session. If you wish to create visualizations with your own dataset(s), please take a look at how to prepare your data by clicking on Formatting Data  .


All you need to participate is eagerness to explore or present data visually and interactively. Ideally, come with a dataset and a question or even set of questions that you would like to find an answer for through your data exploration. Through this journey you will enjoy the ability to log your progress by creating states and taking notes encapsulated in which we call bookmarks!  if you agree to use VistorianLab - our newly helpful tool- you will not only be able to create bookmarks, but also export them to return to them at a later time or even share them with a colleague!
 
We are  looking forward to hearing from you and learning more from you through your feedback on The Vistorian visualizations and Vistorian Lab bookmarks. (What  do you like the most? What was difficult? How can we improve it?). We would also like to feature your feedback —with your permission—for our research.

## What is this tutorial about?
The tutorial is part of our ongoing research on the usage of dynamic networks and their interactivity. We are interested in improving visualization' interactivity and enhancing the note-taking tool to offer the user a better exploration environment. The tutorial might be of use to you if you are planning to create and explore dynamic and interactive networks (e.g. node-link, matrix, dynamic-ego, and maps) for your research, emphasize findings through interactivity, log your progress, take notes, and/or share your logs with your colleagues.

Visualizations interactivity and note-taking are a powerful means to communicate, log, and share findings  with your colleagues and audience (https://vistorian.github.io/). As part of our ongoing research project at the University of Edinburgh, we are now designing interactive means to enhance understandability of and engagement with dynamic networks.

To solicit feedback on our research and help you build interactive data networks, we run a tutorial with consultation sessions over the next weeks. Our tutorial will cover the different types of interactions and help you explore your data better through interactive visualizations using The Vistorian.

<!-- ## What do we hope to learn? 
Our research focuses on improving the way we communicate data and understand how users use visualizations to explore their data. This particular project seeks to investigate user’s usage of interactivity, note-taking and networks to explore their data. Through the tutorial we hope to learn: 
* How are using interactive dynamic networks to explore your data?
* What was difficult/easy for you?
* What was more/less time consuming?
* What was more/less useful?
* What type of data would you like to explore?
* How can note-taking support the exploration process of data through interactive data visualization?
* Which of these interactions do you think are going to help your audience the most?
* What are critical interactions you see missing from our platform?

These findings will inform our research on enhancing visualization platforms in matter of their interactivity and note-taking features.
